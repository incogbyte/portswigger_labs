This lab uses a JWT-based mechanism for handling sessions. The server supports the `jku` parameter in the JWT header. However, it fails to check whether the provided URL belongs to a trusted domain before fetching the key.

To solve the lab, forge a JWT that gives you access to the admin panel at `/admin`, then delete the user `carlos`.

You can log in to your own account using the following credentials: `wiener:peter`
