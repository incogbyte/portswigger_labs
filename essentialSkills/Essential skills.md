* Obfuscating attacks using encodings
	* To take your skills further, you'll need to **adapt the techniques you've learned to overcome these additional obstacles**, unearthing vulnerabilities that other testers may have overlooked;
	* In this section, we'll provide some suggestions on how you **can obfuscate harmful payloads to evade input filters and other flawed defenses**. Specifically, you'll learn how to use standard encodings to take advantage of misconfigurations and handling discrepancies between connected systems.
*  Using [Burp Scanner](https://portswigger.net/burp/vulnerability-scanner) during manual testing
	* you can optimize your workflow by using Burp Scanner to supplement your own knowledge and intuition.
	* Not only does this reduce the chance of you overlooking things, it can save you valuable time by helping you to rapidly identify potential attack vectors;
	* This means you can concentrate your time and effort on things that can't be easily automated, such as working out how to exploit the vulnerable behavior or chain it with your other findings
