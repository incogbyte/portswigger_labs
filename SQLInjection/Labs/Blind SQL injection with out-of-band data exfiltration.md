### lab description

This lab contains a [blind SQL injection](https://portswigger.net/web-security/sql-injection/blind) vulnerability. The application uses a tracking cookie for analytics, and performs a SQL query containing the value of the submitted cookie.

The SQL query is executed asynchronously and has no effect on the application's response. However, you can trigger out-of-band interactions with an external domain.

The database contains a different table called `users`, with columns called `username` and `password`. You need to exploit the blind [SQL injection](https://portswigger.net/web-security/sql-injection) vulnerability to find out the password of the `administrator` user.

To solve the lab, log in as the `administrator` user.
