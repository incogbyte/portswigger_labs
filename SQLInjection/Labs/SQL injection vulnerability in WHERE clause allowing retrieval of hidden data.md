### Lab Description


This lab contains a [SQL injection](https://portswigger.net/web-security/sql-injection) vulnerability in the product category filter. When the user selects a category, the application carries out a SQL query like the following:

`SELECT * FROM products WHERE category = 'Gifts' AND released = 1`

To solve the lab, perform a SQL injection attack that causes the application to display one or more unreleased products.


#### Lab solution

- We can send the `'+or+1=1--` payload to retrieve all hidden data, `remember that is dangerous!` 

- Lab solved
