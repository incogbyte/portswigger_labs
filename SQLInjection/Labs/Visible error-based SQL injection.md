### Lab description

This lab contains a [SQL injection](https://portswigger.net/web-security/sql-injection) vulnerability. The application uses a tracking cookie for analytics, and performs a SQL query containing the value of the submitted cookie. The results of the SQL query are not returned.

The database contains a different table called `users`, with columns called `username` and `password`. To solve the lab, find a way to leak the password for the `administrator` user, then log in to their account.


#### Lab solution

1. Trigger the error

2. Adapt the query to include a generic `SELECT` subquery and cast the returned value to an `int` data type:

3. Adapt the request to make a `boolean` result ( no erros will generate)

4. Adapt your generic `SELECT` statement so that it retrieves usernames from the database:

5. Delete the original value of the `TrackingId` cookie to free up some additional characters. Resend the request.

6. Notice that you receive a new error message, which appears to be generated by the database. This suggests that the query was run properly, but you're still getting an error because it unexpectedly returned more than one row

7. Now that you know that the `administrator` is the first user in the table, modify the query once again to leak their password

8. Login with administrator account and solved the lab!
